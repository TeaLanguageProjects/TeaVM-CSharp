**Note: This project is currently under development and the document may not be complete.**

The Tea Language Virtual Machine (TeaVM), as part of the Tea language project, undertakes the task of loading class files and executing bytecode.

What you are currently seeing is a Tea language virtual machine (HotTea virtual machine) written in C # language. Currently, this version of the virtual machine will serve as the main virtual machine for the Tea language. In the future, there may be Tea language virtual machines written in other languages.

Currently, we are using the BSD-3-Clause license. Due to the ongoing development of the project, the license may change in the future. When the license is changed, we will issue a statement.
